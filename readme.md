## Javascript Canvas Examples

I am in the process of trying to learn Javascript.  I am going to attempt to write clean programs that mirror the examples from my Pygame sample repo:  
[Mek's Pygame Samples](https://github.com/Mekire/meks-pygame-samples)

Due to my inexperience with the language, some of the approaches I take may be suboptimal.


### JS fiddle links for specific examples:
