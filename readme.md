## Javascript Canvas Examples

I am in the process of trying to learn Javascript.  I am going to attempt to write clean programs that mirror the examples from my Pygame sample repo:  
[Mek's Pygame Samples](https://github.com/Mekire/meks-pygame-samples)

Due to my inexperience with the language, some of the approaches I take may be suboptimal.


### JS fiddle links for specific examples:
[Canvas Color Change](http://jsfiddle.net/Mekire/ms6mhhLn/embedded/result/)  
[Draggable Square](http://jsfiddle.net/Mekire/56youx6p/embedded/result/)  
[8-Direction Movement](http://jsfiddle.net/Mekire/hhv4fuja/embedded/result/)
